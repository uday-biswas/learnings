-> what is ingress
   ingress is a kubernetes object that allows access to your kubernetes services from outside the kubernetes cluster.
   
-> ingress controller is needed for ingress to work. 
ingress controller is a daemon, deployed as a kubernetes pod, 
that watches the apiserver's /ingresses endpoint for updates to the 
ingress resource. its job is to satisfy requests for ingress.
 
- command to install minikube nginx ingress controller is minikube addons enable ingress
- command to check the status of ingress controller is kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
- make a ingress.yml file and apply it using kubectl apply -f ingress.yml
  - example content of ingress.yml file
        apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
        kind: Ingress
        metadata:
        name: ingress-example
        spec:
        rules:
        - host: "foo.bar.com"
            http:
            paths:
            - pathType: Prefix
                path: "/bar"
                backend:
                service:
                    name: python-app
                    port:
                    number: 80

- command to check the status and ip address of the ingress is kubectl get ingress
- edit the /etc/hosts file and add the ip address of the ingress and the host name of the ingress - 192.168.49.2    foo.bar.com
- now you can access the application using the host name foo.bar.com/bar
